POINTS: 2.0
KEY: Super near complete. Missing a bit on edit/delete and a few comments, but great work overall.

## MERN/CRUD Classwork

### Exercise:

#### RSVP Web Service
* Use the starter code. The code for the web service has all endpoints implemented other than ```delete``` and ```update```. You will need to implement those service endpoints.
* Test all backend service endpoints with PostMan *before* proceeding!

#### RSVP React Client:
* Start with the React skeleton provided.
* Build a view for ```Listing All RSVPs```. Each entry should allow the user to ```Edit```/```Delete``` the RSVP. A button/link also should be provided to create a ```New``` RSVP.
* You *must* use React Router to handle requests to your components.

### Challenges:
* Users should be prompted to confirm deletion of entries.
* Add the additional fields ```Address``` and ```Phone number``` to model. Make all necessary updates.
* Experiement with CSS/Bootstrap and/or other methods to improve your site.
